Hair Transplant Techniques Overview

Istanbul Medic offers a range of advanced hair transplant techniques to address various patterns and degrees of hair loss. The primary methods used are Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), Direct Hair Implantation (DHI), and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). Each technique has its own distinct approach to harvesting and implanting hair follicles. The choice of procedure depends on several factors, including the extent of hair loss, the condition of the donor area, and the patient's aesthetic goals. During a thorough consultation, our medical experts will assess your specific situation and recommend the most suitable technique to achieve optimal density and a natural appearance.

FUE Hair Transplant

Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) is a modern and widely preferred hair transplant method. The procedure involves extracting individual follicular units, which are small bundles of one to four hairs, directly from a donor area. This donor area is typically located on the back and sides of the scalp, where the hair is genetically resistant to the hormone DHT, which causes male pattern baldness. Using a specialized micro-punch tool, the surgeon carefully removes each graft. These harvested grafts are then meticulously implanted into incisions made in the recipient area, which is the area experiencing thinning or baldness. A significant advantage of the FUE technique is that it is minimally invasive and does not leave a linear scar, resulting in a shorter recovery period compared to more traditional methods.

Sapphire FUE Technique

The Sapphire FUE technique is an advanced refinement of the standard FUE method. This innovation lies in the tool used to create incisions in the recipient area. Instead of traditional steel blades, the Sapphire FUE technique utilizes blades made from sapphire, a durable gemstone that allows for sharper, finer, and more precise incisions. These V-shaped sapphire blades enable the surgeon to create smaller micro-channels, which reduces trauma to the scalp tissue and minimizes scab formation. This precision allows for a higher density of transplanted hair and greater control over the angle and direction of hair growth, leading to more natural-looking results. The reduced tissue damage also contributes to a faster and smoother healing process for the patient.

DHI Hair Transplant

Direct Hair Implantation (DHI) is another advanced evolution of the FUE method. The key difference in the DHI technique is the implantation process. After the hair follicles are extracted from the donor area, they are loaded into a specialized implanting device known as a Choi pen. This pen allows the surgeon to implant each follicle directly into the recipient area without needing to create pre-made incisions. The Choi pen simultaneously makes the incision and places the graft inside. This method offers the surgeon precise control over the depth, angle, and direction of each implanted hair, which is crucial for achieving a dense and natural appearance. By minimizing the time the grafts spend outside the body, the DHI technique can also enhance the survival rate of the transplanted follicles.

FUT Hair Transplant

Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT), also known as the strip method, is a more traditional hair transplant technique. This procedure involves surgically removing a thin strip of scalp from the donor area, usually the back of the head. The strip is then dissected under high-powered microscopes by a skilled technical team to separate the individual follicular units. These grafts are subsequently implanted into the recipient areas. While FUE has become more popular due to its minimally invasive nature, FUT can be a suitable option for patients requiring a large number of grafts in a single session. The primary drawback of the FUT method is that it leaves a linear scar in the donor area, which may be visible if the hair is cut very short.

No-Shave FUE

For patients who wish to maintain their existing hair length and return to their daily routines with minimal visible signs of a procedure, the no-shave FUE technique is an excellent option. In a traditional FUE transplant, the entire head is often shaved. However, with the no-shave technique, it is possible to perform the procedure without shaving the recipient area, and in some cases, by only trimming small, easily concealable sections of the donor area. The physician carefully removes the hair follicles from among the long hairs in the donor area and transplants them into the thinning regions. This approach is particularly popular among individuals who require less downtime and wish to keep their hair transplant discreet.

Beard and Moustache Transplant

Istanbul Medic provides beard and moustache transplantation for men who experience patchy facial hair growth, have sparse areas due to genetics, or wish to conceal scars from injuries or burns. The procedure is suitable for individuals over the age of 22, when facial hair growth has typically stabilized. Using the FUE technique, hair follicles are harvested from a dense donor area, such as the back of the scalp, and then meticulously implanted into the beard or moustache region. The surgeon pays close attention to the angle and direction of the implanted hairs to create a full and natural-looking beard that aligns with the patient's desired aesthetic. The entire process is performed under local anesthesia and is designed to achieve a seamless transformation.

Eyebrow and Womenâ€™s Hair Transplant

Eyebrows are a defining facial feature, and hair transplantation offers a permanent solution for those with thin or sparse brows due to genetics, over-plucking, or medical conditions. The procedure requires extreme precision, as single-hair grafts are carefully implanted to follow the natural arch and growth pattern of the eyebrows. The FUE method is typically used to harvest fine hairs from the donor area to ensure a delicate and natural result. Istanbul Medic also offers hair transplant procedures specifically tailored for women experiencing hair thinning or female pattern hair loss. Our medical team conducts a thorough assessment to determine the cause of hair loss and develops a personalized treatment plan to restore density and achieve natural-looking, aesthetically pleasing results.

Stem-Cell and PRP Therapies

Stem cell therapy is an innovative approach used as a supplementary treatment to enhance the results of a hair transplant. This procedure utilizes the regenerative capabilities of a patient's own stem cells, which are typically harvested from adipose (fat) tissue. These processed stem cells are then injected into the scalp, where they work to rejuvenate dormant hair follicles, improve blood circulation, and reduce inflammation. This creates a healthier environment for both existing and newly transplanted hairs to thrive. Similarly, Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy involves injecting a concentration of a patient's own platelets into the scalp. The growth factors in PRP help stimulate hair follicles, promote healing after a transplant, and can increase the thickness and health of the hair shafts.

Mesotherapy and Hair Strengthening

Hair mesotherapy is a non-surgical treatment aimed at nourishing and strengthening hair follicles to combat hair loss and improve hair quality. The procedure involves administering microinjections of a specialized cocktail of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other active ingredients directly into the scalp. This technique ensures that the nutrients are delivered directly to the hair follicles, improving blood circulation in the scalp and promoting healthier, stronger hair growth. Mesotherapy can be used as a standalone treatment to address early-stage hair loss or in conjunction with a hair transplant procedure to support the health of the scalp and enhance the overall outcome by strengthening both native and transplanted hairs.

Hair Transplant Aftercare and Recovery

Proper aftercare is critical to the long-term success of a hair transplant. The initial 48 hours are crucial, during which patients should avoid touching the transplanted area and sleep with their head elevated to minimize swelling. Gentle hair washing can typically begin after two or three days, using a special shampoo and following the specific techniques provided by our medical team to avoid dislodging the fragile grafts. Strenuous physical activity, excessive sweating, and direct sun exposure should be avoided for at least two weeks. Itching is a normal part of healing, but scratching must be avoided. It is also advised to abstain from smoking and alcohol, as they can impede blood circulation and slow the healing process. New hair growth typically begins within three to four months, with the final, mature results becoming visible after 10 to 15 months.
