## Feature: Simplified Agent Architecture with Enhanced Appointment Management

### Overview
This PR implements a simplified multi-agent architecture with production-ready phone validation, comprehensive patient questionnaire system, and enhanced appointment management capabilities.

### Architecture Changes

#### Simplified Agent System
- **Manager with agents as tools pattern** - Replaced complex handoff system with clean tool-based architecture
- **Removed language agents** - Disabled German and Spanish agents as requested
- **Repurposed English agent** - Now serves as Knowledge Agent for general information
- **Session memory integration** - Added OpenAIConversationsSession for conversation persistence

#### Enhanced Phone Validation
- **libphonenumber integration** - Production-ready international phone validation
- **Prompt-based validation** - Clear validation rules in Anna's instructions
- **E.164 formatting** - Standardized phone number storage
- **Rejects invalid numbers** - Properly handles "+1234", "+123456" etc.

### Patient Questionnaire System

#### Comprehensive Information Collection
- **13 detailed questions** - Medical background, hair loss status, demographics
- **Professional approach** - Confident information collection with explanations
- **Optional but encouraged** - Allows skipping but explains importance
- **Structured flow** - Clear progression through questionnaire categories

### Appointment Management (New User Stories)

#### User Story 1: Change Appointment
- **Reschedule appointments** with step-by-step guidance
- **View current appointments** with clear formatting
- **Time slot selection** with multiple options
- **Confirmation process** before making changes

#### User Story 2: Cancel Appointment
- **Cancel appointments** with confirmation process
- **Appointment identification** with clear options
- **Confirmation details** before cancellation
- **Alternative suggestions** when appropriate

### Code Quality Improvements

#### Dead Code Cleanup
- **Removed 961 lines** of unused code
- **Deleted unused files** - scheduling_models.py, scheduling_services.py
- **Cleaned up imports** - Removed all unused imports and exports
- **Simplified validators** - Only essential functions remain

#### Enhanced Validation
- **Time conflict checking** before rescheduling
- **Business hours validation** (9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Appointment verification** before changes
- **Error handling** for edge cases

### Technical Implementation

#### Tools Available
- create_calendar_event - Book new consultation appointments
- list_upcoming_events - View upcoming appointments and check availability
- delete_event - Cancel appointments by event ID
- delete_event_by_title - Cancel appointments by searching for title/name
- reschedule_event - Change appointment time by event ID
- reschedule_event_by_title - Change appointment time by searching for title/name

#### Session Memory
- **OpenAIConversationsSession** - Automatic conversation history management
- **Context persistence** - Maintains user information across turns
- **No manual state management** - SDK handles all conversation state
