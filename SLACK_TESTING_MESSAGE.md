## 🚀 **New Features Ready for Testing!**

Hey team! 👋 

We've just deployed some major improvements to our WhatsApp Agent and need your help testing the new features. The system is now much more robust and user-friendly!

### 🆕 **What's New:**

**1. Enhanced Phone Validation** 📱
- Now properly validates phone numbers with country codes
- Rejects invalid numbers like "+1234" with helpful error messages
- **Landline numbers are rejected** - only mobile numbers accepted for SMS reminders
- Supports international formats: +1 415 555 2671, +44 20 7946 0958, etc.

**2. Session Memory** 🧠
- Anna now remembers everything you tell her across the conversation
- She'll remember your name, phone number, and appointment details
- No more repeating information - context is maintained throughout the chat

**3. Appointment Management** 📅
- **Reschedule appointments** - "I need to reschedule my appointment"
- **Cancel appointments** - "I want to cancel my consultation" 
- **View appointments** - "What appointments do I have?"
- All with step-by-step guidance and confirmation

**4. Enhanced Patient Questionnaire** 📋
- More confident and professional approach to collecting medical information
- Explains why each question is important for personalized consultation
- Still optional but encourages participation
